# SlimeTactics

Work in progress prototype of a 3D tactical autobattler developed in Unity

Play as the Slime King who can summon slimes on a tactictal grid to protect himself from enemy slimes from another Kingdom. 
You can give them specific orders or let them decide what the best move is. 
Even if slimes will fight for you, don't forget to stay out of battle because you cannot defend yourself on your own!
